                            <p>
                                PHP (recursive acronym for PHP: Hypertext Preprocessor) is a widely-used open source
                                general-purpose scripting language that is especially suited for web development and can
                                be embedded into HTML.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                Nice, but what does that mean? An example:
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                Instead of lots of commands to output HTML (as seen in C or Perl), PHP pages contain
                                HTML with embedded code that does "something" (in this case, output "Hi, I'm a PHP
                                script!"). The PHP code is enclosed in special <a
                                    href="https://www.php.net/manual/en/language.basic-syntax.phpmode.php" target="_blank">start and
                                    end processing instructions
                                    &lt;?tphp and ?&gt;
                                </a>that allow you to jump into and out of "PHP mode."
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                What distinguishes PHP from something like client-side JavaScript is that the code is
                                executed on the server, generating HTML which is then sent to the client. The client
                                would receive the results of running that script, but would not know what the underlying
                                code was. You can even configure your web server to process all your HTML files with
                                PHP, and then there's really no way that users can tell what you have up your sleeve.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                The best part about using PHP is that it is extremely simple for a newcomer, but offers
                                many advanced features for a professional programmer. Don't be afraid to read the long
                                list of PHP's features. You can jump in, in a short time, and start writing simple
                                scripts in a few hours.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                TAlthough PHP's development is focused on server-side scripting, you can do much more
                                with it. Read on, and see more in the <a href="https://www.php.net/manual/en/intro-whatcando.php" target="_blank">What can PHP do?</a> section, or go right to the
                               <a href="https://php.net/manual/en/tutorial.php" target="_blank">introductory tutorial</a> if you are only interested in web programming.
