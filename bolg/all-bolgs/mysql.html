                                A database is a structured collection of data. It may be anything from a simple shopping
                                list to a picture gallery or the vast amounts of information in a corporate network. To
                                add, access, and process data stored in a computer database, you need a database
                                management system such as MySQL Server. Since computers are very good at handling large
                                amounts of data, database management systems play a central role in computing, as
                                standalone utilities, or as parts of other applications.
                            </p>
                            <h4>
                                <ul>
                                    <li>
                                        MySQL database are relational .
                                    </li>
                                </ul>
                            </h4>
                            <p>
                                A relational database stores data in separate tables rather than putting all the data in
                                one big storeroom. The database structures are organized into physical files optimized
                                for speed. The logical model, with objects such as databases, tables, views, rows, and
                                columns, offers a flexible programming environment. You set up rules governing the
                                relationships between different data fields, such as one-to-one, one-to-many, unique,
                                required or optional, and “pointers” between different tables. The database enforces
                                these rules, so that with a well-designed database, your application never sees
                                inconsistent, duplicate, orphan, out-of-date, or missing data.

                                The SQL part of “MySQL” stands for “Structured Query Language”. SQL is the most common
                                standardized language used to access databases. Depending on your programming
                                environment, you might enter SQL directly (for example, to generate reports), embed SQL
                                statements into code written in another language, or use a language-specific API that
                                hides the SQL syntax.
                            </p> -->

                                SQL is defined by the ANSI/ISO SQL Standard. The SQL standard has been evolving since
                                1986 and several versions exist. In this manual, “SQL-92” refers to the standard
                                released in 1992, “SQL:1999” refers to the standard released in 1999, and “SQL:2003”
                                refers to the current version of the standard. We use the phrase “the SQL standard” to
                                mean the current version of the SQL Standard at any time.
