                                Python is a high-level, interpreted, general-purpose programming language. Its design
                                philosophy emphasizes code readability with the use of significant indentation. Python
                                is dynamically-typed and garbage-collected. It supports multiple programming paradigms,
                                including structured

                            <p> Python is dynamically-typed and garbage-collected. It supports multiple programming
                                paradigms, including structured (particularly procedural), object-oriented and
                                functional programming. It is often described as a "batteries included" language due to
                                its comprehensive standard library.</p>

                                Guido van Rossum began working on Python in the late 1980s as a successor to the ABC
                                programming language and first released it in 1991 as Python 0.9.0. Python 2.0 was
                                released in 2000 and introduced new features such as list comprehensions,
                                cycle-detecting garbage collection, reference counting, and Unicode support. Python 3.0,
                                released in 2008, was a major revision that is not completely backward-compatible with
                                earlier versions. Python 2 was discontinued with version 2.7.18 in 2020
