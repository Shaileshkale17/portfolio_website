                                JavaScript is a simple and easy-to-learn programming language as compared to other
                                languages such as C++, Ruby, and Python. It is a high-level, interpreted language that
                                can easily be embedded with languages like HTML. It was developed by Netscape
                                Communications Corporation, Mozilla Foundation, and ECMA International. Brendan Eich is
                                known as the creator or designer of the JavaScript programming language.

                                Initially, JavaScript was known as LiveScript, but later Netscape changed its name to
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                JavaScript. Some amazing features of JavaScript are as follows:
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                * Lightweight, interpreted language.
                                <br>
                                * Easily embedded with languages like HTML, CSS, and Java.
                                <br>
                                *Also works as a client-side scripting language, which helps in creating dynamic web
                                pages.
                            </p>

                                JavaScript is an open source and cross-platform language and therefore mostly used for
                                creating network-centric applications. Nowadays it has become an inseparable part of the
                                core technologies of the internet. JavaScript is used in web technologies to make web
                                pages interactive. Along with HTML and CSS, JavaScript is widely used in web servers and
                                databases. Hence its wide popularity among these kinds of websites.
